# Covid-19 Vaccination Dashboard

I have developed this dashboard of interactive visualizations to help analyze the impact the vaccinations have had
on the spread of the virus and the global disparity in vaccine distribution.

## Data Visualizations
This Covid-19 Vaccination dashboard consists of 3 visualizations:

1. The first visualization is of a choropleth map of the world based on the percentage of people vaccinated in each country. Users have the choice to view the map for the people who has received at least one dose of the vaccination, completed the initial vaccination protocol or received a booster dose. This gives users an overview of the vaccination program. It helps them understand the current vaccination status of each country and also identify countries that have not been able to vaccinate even 20% of the population.

2. The second visualization is of a line graph of the vaccinations administered over time. Users have the option to see the graph for Daily Covid-19 vaccination doses administered, Total Covid-19 Vaccination Doses Administered, Daily number of people receiving a first Covid-19 vaccination dose, Total number of people receiving a first Covid-19 vaccination dose, Total number of people who have completed the initial Covid-19 vaccination protocol (i.e., received both the Covid-19 vaccination doses) and Total Covid-19 booster
doses administered. Users also have the option to compare the vaccination program of different locations. This helps them compare the vaccination progress made by each country over time.

3. The third visualization is of a bar chart displaying the weekly Covid-19 cases. The bars of the chart are given different colors based on the percentage of the populations that has been vaccinated up until that week. A legend is provided along with the chart to make it easier for users to understand the meaning behind the colors for the bars. Users can choose to see the bar chart for weekly Covid-19 cases with the colors based on percentage of population vaccinated with one dose of the vaccination, completed the initial vaccination protocol or received a booster dose and also the weekly Covid-19 deaths with the colors based on percentage of population vaccinated with one dose of the vaccination, completed the initial vaccination protocol or received a booster dose. Users can also choose to see the bar chart for different locations using a drop down menu provided right next to the bar chart. This helps users evaluate the effect of vaccinations on Covid-19 cases and deaths.

## User Guidelines

The dashboard has been designed in the following manner:
